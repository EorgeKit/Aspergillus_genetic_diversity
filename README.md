# Aspergillus_genetic_diversity
This repo contains scipts that can be used to assess Aspergillus genetics diversity. This spans around aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters mining, searching for single copy orthologus genes and subsequently plotting of phylogenetic tree

Additionally this project involved the use of announced genomes from:
Aloo MO, Gachanja PW, Muzami EM, Katua K, Mukhebi DW, Musangi CR, Juma BS, Mbinda WM.2024.Draft genome sequence of two Aspergillus aculeatus isolated from cashew nuts from coastal Kenya. Microbiol Resour Announc13:e00460-24.https://doi.org/10.1128/mra.00460-24

Gachanja PW, Onyango MA, Musangi CR, Juma BS, Mukhebi DW, Muzami EM, Katua K, Mbinda WM.2024.Draft genome sequence of 16 Aspergillus flavus isolated from cashew nuts from coastal Kenya. Microbiol Resour Announc13:e00445-24.https://doi.org/10.1128/mra.00445-24 


For annotation of Aflatoxin gene, the physical maps were constructed using geneious prime. The project is ongoing so versions and scripts to be updated soon.
