Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 193758 genes (99.4% of total) to 12701 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 18 or more genes (G50 was 18) and were contained in the largest 5161 orthogroups (O50 was 5161). There were 6966 orthogroups with all species present and 6011 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
